# TCP Client v1

This was a lab completed for ECEn 426, Networking Protocols.
The lab requirements are specified [here](https://ecenetworking.byu.edu/426/labs/tcp-client-v1/) and here:
> For this lab, you will be building a simple TCP client that sends data to a server to be transformed. The client will be a command-line tool that follows standard Unix norms. There are two parts to this lab:
> - Interact with a TCP server using the protocol outlined below.
> - Build a program that can parse command-line options and arguments.
>
> The purpose of the protocol is to have a client send text to a server to transform. The server will convert the text by either uppercasing, lowercasing, reversing, or shuffling the text and send it back to the client. There is also a random action that randomly subtracts and duplicates characters.

I learned many things from this lab such as gaining a deeping understanding and appreciation of TCP/UDP protocalls, how to communicate with remote servers, and the different applications of TCP.
